#Money Matters

Money Matters is a free add-on to Google Sheets which lets you track your expenses and save photos (or scans) of your receipts simultaneously.	
After installation you'll be able to:	
- Easily upload a receipt to your Google Drive and record the purchase's corresponding category, account, cost and more to a beautiful spreadsheet.
- Have all your receipts digitized and organized by month and year for you all in one easily accessible place.
- See exactly where your money is going, be it by category, account, day, and more.
- Quickly reconcile your bank accounts at the end of each month.

To use:
Make a copy of the google sheets file in this folder, and follow the tutorial.

This link will also work if the file fails for any reason:

Money Matters currently works as intended, but there are more features I'm working on:
-	A sheet for reports on the year's spendings
-	Publishing Money Matters as a web app for Chrome
-	Building an HTML interface for the setup/configure process
-	A column for links to a purchase's receipt in Google Drive
-	Changes to spreadsheet construction:
-	Speed improvements
-	Formatting improvements
-	Ability to track income
	And more!
